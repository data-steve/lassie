#' Getting Help for Errors and Warnings
#'
#' Famous pooch Lassie was always there to help Timmy get help with whatever problem he was
#' facing. No matter what Timmy said, Lassie always understood what kind of help
#' was needed and how to ask for it.\cr\cr
#' \pkg{lassie} strives to give R users the same kind of support in finding help
#' for their R needs, by:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Auto-searching for help on StackOverflow, Github, or Google and
#'   \item Auto-templating and posting well-formed questions to StackOverflow, if searches don't help.
