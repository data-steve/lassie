Description: Famous pooch Lassie was always there to help Timmy get help with whatever problem
    he was facing. No matter what Timmy said, Lassie always understood what kind
    of help was needed and how to ask for it. lassie package strives to give R users the
    same kind of support in finding help for their R needs, by
        - Auto-searching for help on StackOverflow, Github, or Google and
        - Auto-templating and posting well-formed questions to StackOverflow, if searches don't help.
